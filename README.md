# Goal(s) of the Analysis:

# Data Collection and Analysis Process:
I got the Expected Goals data (consists of Expected Goals(xG), Expected Goals Against(xGA) and Expected Goal Difference(xGD)) used on the website: https://footystats.org/england/premier-league/. I copied the relevant data and put them in a Google Sheet. I then sorted xG, xGA and xGD and gave them gave the teams ranking based on those metrics, those made up the columns xG#, xGA#, xGD#. I then ran correlation to test how the xG family of metrics are related to the teams actula final positions. 

To provide a comparison, I went to the official premier league website https://www.premierleague.com/tables?co=1&se=210&ha=-1 and got the actual numbers for Goals Scored (GS), Goals Against (GA) and Goal Difference(GD). I also ran correlations to see which is a more correlated metric (between expected and actual numbers) with final positions and if any how much?

Here is the spreadheet with the xG and Actual Goals data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zy8r7orskrtZY9xdxjH6i_0EuZ79t2aOR2904lPXnDc/edit?usp=sharing
